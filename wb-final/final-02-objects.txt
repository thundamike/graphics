(Required) Two kinds of objects created for this assignment:
1. "Fence(1-59)" - A fence made from three primitives with smoothed corner posts.
2. Windmill - made from from three primitives, and an extruded geometry for the blades.

(Required) Five other kinds of objects that you created (possibly in previous assignments):
3. "FarmHouse": made from basic triangle geometry and loaded textures, adapted from WB7
4. "Plant(1-12)": loaded from a .FBX file, attribution below
5. "Tractor": loaded from a .FBX file, attribution below
6. "Rain": simple Three primitive visible when checking "rain" button (I didn't want to include in the LookAt, since all of the drops would pollute the list. It's just a Three Sphere geometry and a gray coloring distorted to have a more rain-like appearance)
7. "Dirt(0-23)": Perlin noise algorithm applied to a fragment shader and SimpleGrCube geometry (attribution below)

(Optional) Backup Objects (more objects that you created, in case the ones above don't count):
- Sunny farm Cube Map for scene background
- Rainy farm Cube Map for scene background

At least one of each type of object:
Building/structure: "FarmHouse" (described above)
Vehicle: "Tractor" (above)
Natural Element: Sunny farm / rainy farm backdrop (or "Rain", if those don't count)

Object loaded from a model file:
Model: "Tractor" (described above)

An object with a shader that you wrote:
ShaderObj: "Dirt(0-23)" (described above)

Other Objects that you would like to note:
The raindrops are not highlighted since they only arrive in the scene conditionally.
