Advanced Things: (not exactly sure how "advanced" these are)

(3) Complex Object: Windmill. Put together many three primitives to form the base, as well as custom shapes for the windmill blades.

(2) Complex behavior: The tractor uses a state machine which is triggered by the user, in which it follows a course to "harvest" each of the crops. As it passes over each crop, the crops are chopped down. Each crop can grow once the rain is initiated by the user.

(4) Particle system: Rain made from Three primitives is initiated by the user, and falls at a random rate. 

(12) Use noise: The dirt patches make use of Perlin noise to give the appearance of a random dirt-like texture.
