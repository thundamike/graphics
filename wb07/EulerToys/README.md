# CS559 Euler Toys

The Euler Toys are gadgets that I have built up over the years to help teach
about rotation and orientation.

They are interactive demos, built with THREE.js and the CS559 class Framework.

Over the years, they have served as interactive props in lecture, online demos
for students to play with, examples in workbooks, and sample code. Because of
these different usages, many copies proliferated and I wanted to get them all
in one place.

In March of 2023, I tried to assemble the EulerToys in one place. This way it can
be used as a module in other things (like workbooks and websites and lecture notes).

This module is just the EulerToys code. It assumes that the CS559 version of THREE
and the CS559 Framework and the CS559 workbook style library are all in ../libs.

### What's here

+ `et1` - the basic Euler Toy, 1 set of Euler Angles


### What's not here...

+ `07-02-01` - this becomes ET3 and ET4 (gimball lock and bad interpolation)
