Explain how you incorporated a material property map here and what its effect is (how can we see it?)

Created a brick texture map for roughness (from an image) on the top of the cube,
which responds to a light source by having a metallic quality when illuminated. 
Once the texture map is in place, the brick pattern can begin to reflect the light shone 
on the cube.

To see this, zoom into the cube and tilt the camera towards the top of the cube, and adjust the tilt angle
to see different lighting patterns.
The brick pattern will visibly reflect the light in certain areas, depending on perspective.
